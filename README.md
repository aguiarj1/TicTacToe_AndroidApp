# Tic-Tac-Toe Android Application
A Tic-Tac-Toe android app game. Written in Java using Android Studio. 

## Description: 
This android application is a standard implementation of the game tic-tac-toe.
It uses "X" and "O" to represent each player. On each turn, a player picks a 
square until one of the players either connects three squares or until there
are no more spaces to pick from.   

## Why this project exists: 
This project was used to practice using Android Studio to develop mobile applications. 

## Additional modifications or features I plan to make: 
* I plan to modify the logic of the game, so that the methods are more intuitive. 
* I plan to introduce a one-player mode, where the players plays against the computer. 

## How to run it: 
Open it in Android Studio.
